 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    My journey into coding began in middle school when I initially joined a computer science class for its Photoshop course. However, I quickly became captivated by coding after our teacher posed algorithm questions to students from other courses. I love a good puzzle, and this sparked my interest in programming.
    For a couple of years, I delved deeply into problem-solving and math, almost completely pausing my coding activities. When the time came to choose a career path, I realized that creating and integrating real-life solutions was more exciting to me than theoretical calculations. Now, after two years of college, I am pursuing my Computer Science degree with a focus on algorithms.

### Interests
<details>
  <summary><h3> üïπÔ∏è My Relax Time </h3></summary>
I am a huge fan of Souls games, with Sekiro being my favorite. These games teach patience and determination to overcome obstacles. I also enjoy playing Minecraft, where I can unleash my creativity or simply relax and immerse myself in a good story. This love for engaging narratives extends to books and movies as well.

Gaming is also a way for me to connect with my long-distance friends. Additionally, like most people, I enjoy listening to music, particularly soundtracks from games and movies I've experienced. Music helps me focus while working.

Another passion of mine is gastronomy. While I don't cook often, I love watching and reading about cooking techniques and products from different countries. Learning about various food cultures fascinates me, and I dream of traveling to these countries to try their local cuisine and do some sightseeing.
